comprehensive web application for performing Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis using Streamlit. The application allows users to fetch bioactivity data from a ChEMBL database, compute molecular fingerprints, and train machine learning models for regression and classification tasks. It supports SMILES input files and outputs predictions based on trained models.

Importance and Advantages of the Solution
Importance:

Efficient Drug Discovery:
QSAR analysis is crucial in predicting the bioactivity of chemical compounds, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with drug discovery.

Data-Driven Decisions:
By leveraging bioactivity data and molecular fingerprints, researchers can make more informed decisions about which compounds to prioritize for further testing.

Advantages:
Streamlined Workflow:
The web app integrates data fetching, fingerprint computation, and model training into a single platform, simplifying the workflow for users.

User-Friendly Interface:
With Streamlit, the application provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with, making complex processes accessible to those with limited programming knowledge.

Scalable and Customizable:
The modular design allows users to easily update the models and datasets, ensuring the tool remains relevant and effective as new data becomes available.

Reproducibility:
By automating the QSAR process, the web app ensures that results are reproducible and consistent, which is critical for scientific research.

Accessibility:
Researchers and developers can access and use the app from any location, facilitating collaboration and data sharing.
